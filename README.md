      In this file, we explore the metadata downloaded from the Kaggle website. We take a look at some of the images of the spectograms in the dataset.
      We make decisions about what attributes to keep, and we split the matedata into training (70%), validation (20%) and test (10%) datasets.
      We also discuss our ideas about further progress later on: we plan to split the spectrograms into smaller chunks (10 seconds for example) and we will use that to train our model.
